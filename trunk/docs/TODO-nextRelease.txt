This is the place where pending items will be placed, until such time as 
cs-project is stable enough to setup a tracker on CrazedSanity.com...

2.) Remove Dependency on Stored Procedures
	* build code that handles what the stored procedures do, so there's no 
	longer a reliance on if PL/pgsql is built-in to PostgreSQL or not (its just 
	another hurdle for setup, and makes it less easy to use).
	
4.) Display Issues
	* consider something *besides* using the <pre> tags for display...
	
5.) Tasks for Helpdesk Issues
	* allow adding of tasks to helpdesk issues just like projects.
	* anonymous users can only view list of tasks (no details).
	* notes are for users that can't access the tasks, and for general 
	information/discussion.

6;) Email Notifications
	* Applicability (should be sent to):
		-- assigned user
		-- submitted user
		-- users that have made comments
		-- users that have assigned tasks (see "Tasks for Helpdesk Issues")
	* option to remove self from being notified on an issue (requires 
	maintaining a list of users that should be contacted per issue)?

7.) Permissions System (consider PHPGACL)
	* roles:
		-- administrator
		-- developer
		-- manager
		-- user (not quite anonymous)
	* permissions:
		-- read
		-- write/modify
		-- create
		-- delete
	* ANONYMOUS PERMISSIONS
		-- what items can be read
		-- what can be modified/commented on
	* specific items to assign permissions to:
		-- contact records
		-- projects
		-- parents of projects that aren't assigned to user
		-- helpdesk issues
		-- todo's (tasks)
		-- user settings (is_admin, group_id, etc)
 
8.) User Registration
	* users should be able to register for an account
	* new users have access to read but not edit items.

9.) Group Problems
	* Should groups be re-implemented? (consider removing from this release)
		-- remove ability to switch active group
		-- ability to assign a project/helpdesk issue to a specific group 
		(make a valid reason for it... think YagNi).
	* Summary shows items created in different groups (clicking them causes 
	errors), possibly in a group the user isn't a member of.
	* Helpdesk issues aren't displayed on a per-group basis (should they?)
	* Need ability to create new groups.

11.) Cascading Changes
	* deadline extensions:
		-- capture extension interval:
		-- offer to extend all deadlines by that much
		-- show screen which allows mass-edit of associated items
	* deadline tightening
		-- capture tightened interval (number of days lost)
		-- show screen which allows mass-edit of associated items; mark all 
		sub-items that go beyond the new deadline in red (or otherwise show them 
		as needing attention)
	* user association
		-- should user also be assigned to all parent projects when assigning to 
		a given project?

12.) Contact Listing/Modification
	* logged-in users can view their own contact details
	* group admins can modify contact details of *users* in their group
	* administrators (NOT group admin) can modify contact details of any user

	
NOTES ON REMOVING GROUPS (possibility thereof):::
	* what about supporting the ability from previous versions?
	* PHProject (I believe) still has this ability... would it detract them 
	from using cs-project over PHProject?
