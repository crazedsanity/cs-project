This is the place where pending items will be placed, until such time as 
cs-project is stable enough to setup a tracker on CrazedSanity.com...

1.) Session Issues
	* errors seem to randomly occur "projectClass::set_group_id: unable to 
	determine group_id... session probably invalid"
	
4.) Display Issues
	* word wrapping gets hairy on some helpdesk issues: sometimes it wraps to the 
	next line, one word is displayed, then it's wrapped again.
	* consider using/supporting BBCode, for nicer display of code & such.

10.) Defaults for Data
	* end date for project not set
	* begin date for todo not set
	

13.) Search Options
	* ability to find/display ended projects	
	* find ANY record (project, helpdesk, todo, note) based on:
		-- attached tag (project/helpdesk only)
		-- name
		-- body
		-- begin/create date
		-- deadline/ended date
		-- status
		
	
NOTES ON REMOVING GROUPS (possibility thereof):::
	* what about supporting the ability from previous versions?
	* PHProject (I believe) still has this ability... would it detract them 
	from using cs-project over PHProject?
