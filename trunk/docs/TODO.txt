This is the place where pending items will be placed, until such time as 
cs-project is stable enough to setup a tracker on CrazedSanity.com...

1.) Session Issues
	* errors seem to randomly occur "projectClass::set_group_id: unable to determine group_id... session probably invalid"
	
2.) Remove Dependency on Stored Procedures
	* build code that handles what the stored procedures do, so there's no 
	longer a reliance on if PL/pgsql is built-in to PostgreSQL or not (its just 
	another hurdle for setup, and makes it less easy to use).
	
3.) Email Classes
	* the current classes are very out-of-date: look into something like 
	"PHPMailer" (http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpmailer/) instead.
	
4.) Display Issues
	* wordwrapping gets hairy on some helpdesk issues: sometimes it wraps to the 
	next line, one word is displayed, then it's wrapped again.
	* consider something *besides* using the <pre> tags for display...
	* consider using/supporting BBCode, for nicer display of code & such.
