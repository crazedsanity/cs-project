This is the place where pending items will be placed, until such time as 
cs-project is stable enough to setup a tracker on CrazedSanity.com...

1.) Session Issues
	* errors seem to randomly occur "projectClass::set_group_id: unable to 
	determine group_id... session probably invalid"
	
2.) Remove Dependency on Stored Procedures
	* build code that handles what the stored procedures do, so there's no 
	longer a reliance on if PL/pgsql is built-in to PostgreSQL or not (its just 
	another hurdle for setup, and makes it less easy to use).
	
3.) Email Classes
	* the current classes are very out-of-date: look into something like 
	"PHPMailer" (http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpmailer/) instead.
	
4.) Display Issues
	* wordwrapping gets hairy on some helpdesk issues: sometimes it wraps to the 
	next line, one word is displayed, then it's wrapped again.
	* consider something *besides* using the <pre> tags for display...
	* consider using/supporting BBCode, for nicer display of code & such.
	
5.) Tasks for Helpdesk Issues
	* allow adding of tasks to helpdesk issues just like projects.
	* anonymous users can only view list of tasks (no details).
	* notes are for users that can't access the tasks, and for general 
	information/discussion.

6;) Email Notifications
	* don't always get sent
	* Applicability (should be sent to):
		-- assigned user
		-- submitted user
		-- users that have made comments
		-- users that have assigned tasks (see "Tasks for Helpdesk Issues")

7.) Permissions System (consider PHPGACL)
	* roles:
		-- administrator
		-- developer
		-- manager
		-- user (not quite anonymous)
	* permissions:
		-- read
		-- write/modify
		-- create
		-- delete
 
8.)User Registration
	* users should be able to register for an account
	* new users have access to read but not edit items.
