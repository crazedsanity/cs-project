# HELP WANTED!!!

CS-Project has been out-of-date for several years.  Currently, supporting libraries are in the process of being upgraded.  To ease the process, all feature requests and bug reports should be handled through GitHub's issue tracker.

CS-Project is in need of development, documentation, testers, and anyone willing to help setup some of the automated tasks associated with software development.  If you can program, run a mouse and a browser, or can do some system administration type stuff, please contact me. It could definitely use some "Web 2.0" love.

Here's just a short list of things that can be (or need to be) done, in no particular order:
 * automated unit testing
 	* a plan on how to do this (e.g. using Jenkins, etc)

Supporting Libraries:
 * [CS Content, MVC/Templating System](https://github.com/crazedsanity/cs-content)
 * [CS PHP XML Framework](https://github.com/crazedsanity/cs-phpxml)
 * [CS Web Application Libraries](https://github.com/crazedsanity/cs-webapplibs)
 * [SimpleTest, a PHP Unit Testing Framework](http://www.simpletest.org)

# CS-Project

CS-Project is a PostgreSQL + PHP driven project management website. All projects can have notes, todo's, and associated helpdesk issues. Supports separation of projects into teams/groups. It has an extensive logging system and unique upgrade system for ease of upgrading.

There's some documents in the "docs" folder (imagine that) which might be useful:
 * [Features](docs/features.md)
 * [Upgrading](docs/upgrading.md)
